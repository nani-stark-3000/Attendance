# About

* This repo is a project of conecting excel and python.

* Actually my teacher asked me to maintain an excel sheet for attendence.

* Alredy i have list of roll numbers and names in an excel sheet. 

* If student was absent then in that row on that purticular day coloumn mark as '0' if present its '1'

* Iam least intreasted to enter 0s and 1s manually.

* so i have created this python code which takes input as 

>>Excel file path : (for example "D:\c++ attendance list.xlsx")

>>Day : (for example if its day-1 then "1")

* we have latral entries and normal students in our class so it takes list of absenties and automaticaly assign 0 for absentis and 1 for present

>>nlist = (for example 01 02 03 04)

>>llist = (for example 01 02 03 04)

* finally the same excel sheet will be re-writed.
